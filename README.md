# COVID Map Project

COVID Map is a web application that visualizes COVID-19 data worldwide and provides detailed information about countries. This project was developed using ReactJS, Redux Toolkit, Redux Thunk, and Tailwind CSS. In addition, libraries such as Jest, Redux-mock-store, and React Testing Library were used to learn and implement unit tests.
